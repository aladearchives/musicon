#### About
This is a simulation of a website for a Musical festial, complete with a store for purchasing musical items. Front End only.
<p>I learnt how to use HandleBars to render dynamic data and replicate repeated blocks of code in several places. I also got the chance to work on a great side for a music festival with a shop section. Front end only
